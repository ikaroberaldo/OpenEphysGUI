#  Custom options file for astyle (astyle.sourceforge.net), a source code
#  formatter for C/C++ (and some other languages).
#
#  Since it's clunky to use this program on windows and mac (it's a commandline
#  program, but there's no installer), the real point is just to be able to
#  enforce some general sanity on the codebase every once in a while.  That
#  said, the general prescription below will actually work on all available
#  platforms, with the caveat that on windows and mac you might have to figure
#  in the actual path to the astyle binary.
#
#  usage:
#  cd Source
#  astyle --options="../astyle.options" "./*"
#

#  The above commands will format the entire source tree using a style which
#  mostly conforms to that of the Juce library
#  (www.juce.com/wiki/index.php/Coding_Standards).
#
#  Some documentation of the options is provided here for convenience.  For full
#  options documentation, go to astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html.


# No backup file suffix, i.e. don't back up the files, since this would just
# make a mess of the source tree.  If astyle screws up, we'll rely on git.
